# Configuration for Tobacco T5 Scenario
metadata:
  label: "Tobacco - T5 - Mass media campaigns"
  description: |
    Mass media campaign intervention that implements effective campaigns educating the public about the harms of smoking/tobacco use and second-hand smoke.
    This scenario exposes the parameters for public education campaigns that work by increasing awareness of tobacco health risks and motivating behavior change.
    The intervention reduces tobacco prevalence in the population through sustained messaging about health consequences, which in turn reduces the incidence rates of asthma among susceptible individuals.
    Mass media campaigns reach broad audiences with anti-tobacco messaging, counter tobacco industry marketing, and provide social support for quit attempts.
    Effective campaigns use multiple media channels and evidence-based messaging to change social norms around tobacco use and encourage cessation.
    Note: For a comprehensive understanding of tobacco control impacts, this intervention should also be run for COPD, Diabetes, and Cardiovascular Disease models.
