# Configuration for Tobacco T7 Scenario
metadata:
  label: "Tobacco - T7 - Pharmacological cessation aids"
  description: |
    Tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy intervention that provides cost-covered effective pharmacological interventions to all tobacco users who want to quit.
    This scenario exposes the parameters for cessation medication policies that work by providing nicotine replacement therapy, prescription medications, and other pharmacological aids to support quit attempts.
    The intervention reduces tobacco prevalence in the population by increasing successful quit rates through medication-assisted treatment, which in turn reduces the incidence rates of asthma among susceptible individuals.
    Pharmacological interventions include nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum, lozenges), prescription medications (bupropion, varenicline), and other evidence-based cessation aids.
    These medications are most effective when combined with behavioral support and when made accessible through healthcare coverage and reduced cost barriers.
    Note: For a comprehensive understanding of tobacco control impacts, this intervention should also be run for COPD, Diabetes, and Cardiovascular Disease models.
