# Configuration for CR3 Scenario
metadata:
  label: "Appendix 3 - CR3 Scenario"
  description: |
    Long-term management of asthma with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. This scenario exposes the parameters for a comprehensive asthma management approach including Low Dose Beclometasone, High Dose Beclometasone, and Inhaled Short-Acting Beta Agonist interventions.
    This was the mapping for the CR3 Scenario in Appendix 3 simulations.
    Low Dose Beclometasone reduces the disability weight of persons living with Asthma by 8% and reduces asthma case fatality by 50%.
    High Dose Beclometasone reduces the disability weight by 13.2%.
    Inhaled Short-Acting Beta Agonist provides symptom relief, reducing the disability weight by approximately 1%.
    All three interventions increase their target coverage from the baseline of five percent to ninety-five percent, which was a standard coverage change for Appendix 3 simulations.
    This should typically be run as a comparison scenario, with the baseline scenario being the Asthma Baseline, or this same scenario but with the target coverage having a smaller scale-up coverage.
