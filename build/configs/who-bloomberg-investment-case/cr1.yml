# Configuration for CR1 Scenario
metadata:
  label: "Appendix 3 - CR1 Scenario"
  description: |
    Acute treatment of asthma exacerbations with inhaled bronchodilators and oral steroids.
    This scenario exposes the parameters for the Oral Prednisolone intervention.
    This was the mapping for the CR1 Scenario in Appendix 3 simulations.
    Oral prednisolone reduces the disability weight of persons living with Asthma.
    It increases the target coverage from the baseline of five percent, to the target coverage of ninety-five percent,
    which was a standard coverage change for Appendix 3 simulations.
    This should typically be run as a comparison scenario, with the baseline scenario being the Asthma Baseline, or this same scenario but with the target coverage having a smaller scale-up coverage.
