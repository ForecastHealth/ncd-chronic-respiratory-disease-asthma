# Configuration for Tobacco T4 Scenario
metadata:
  label: "Tobacco - T4 - Smoke-free environments"
  description: |
    Smoke-free environment intervention that eliminates exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke in all indoor workplaces, public places, and public transport.
    This scenario exposes the parameters for smoke-free policies that work by protecting non-smokers from second-hand smoke exposure and encouraging tobacco users to quit.
    The intervention reduces tobacco prevalence in the population by making tobacco use less convenient and socially acceptable, which in turn reduces the incidence rates of asthma among susceptible individuals.
    Smoke-free laws protect both current non-smokers from harmful second-hand smoke exposure and create social pressure and practical barriers that encourage tobacco users to quit.
    This intervention has dual benefits: immediate protection from second-hand smoke and long-term reductions in tobacco use prevalence.
    Note: For a comprehensive understanding of tobacco control impacts, this intervention should also be run for COPD, Diabetes, and Cardiovascular Disease models.
