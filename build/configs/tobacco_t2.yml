# Configuration for Tobacco T2 Scenario
metadata:
  label: "Tobacco - T2 - Warning labels and standardized packaging"
  description: |
    Tobacco warning label intervention that implements plain/standardized packaging and large graphic health warnings on all tobacco packages.
    This scenario exposes the parameters for warning label policies that work by educating consumers about tobacco health risks and reducing the appeal of tobacco products.
    The intervention reduces tobacco prevalence in the population through increased awareness and deterrence, which in turn reduces the incidence rates of asthma among susceptible individuals.
    Graphic warnings and plain packaging make tobacco products less attractive and reinforce health messaging to current and potential tobacco users.
    The intervention includes coverage scale-up parameters that can be adjusted to simulate different implementation timelines and population reach.
    Note: For a comprehensive understanding of tobacco control impacts, this intervention should also be run for COPD, Diabetes, and Cardiovascular Disease models.
